If you want to interact here:

### You are an end user and ...

#### ... you are missing a feature
If the feature is on the roadmap, feel free to head to the corresponding issue.
You can leave your upvote, discuss details and give me more information on what you need.

If the feature isn't on the roadmap, browse/search the issues to see if someone else has already requested it.
If that isn't the case - feel free to open a new issue to let me know what you need.

#### ... STL-Vault crashed on your system
Yikes, sorry! You can help by reporting the crash:
- If you can still open STLVault, use the `(!)` button and create a crash archive.
- Submit the archive either by:
  - create a new issue for your crash and attach the zip
  - join the [discord](https://discord.gg/sexQM8R) and report there

#### ... STL-Vault didn't process a file correctly
Same as reporting a crash, but to speed up the process:
- include a link to the file if it is _openly available_
- do _not_ attach files to issues

Do _not_ share files against their license or without the authors permission!

### You want to work on this project
Fist of all: Thanks, that's awesome!

I'll accept pull request if they provide value for a good part of the user base.
Opening an issue or chatting with the developer(s) in the discord to discuss changes 
beforehand doesn't hurt either.

If you want to play around with the sources on your own look at the [Developer docs](DEVELOPMENT.md).

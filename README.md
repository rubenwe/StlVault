Yikes, sorry! You can help by reporting the crash via a new issue.
Attach the `Player.log` found in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\StlVault\StlVault` to the issue.

#### ... STL-Vault didn't process a file correctly
You can open an issue with a link to the file if it is _openly available_. 
Do _not_ attach files to issues. If the file isn't openly available, 
there is not a lot I can do right now.
Don't share files without the authors permission!

Fist of all: Thanks, that's awesome!

I'll accept pull request if they provide value for a good part of the user base.
Opening an issue to discuss changes beforehand doesn't hurt either.
